# LeetCode
## Week 4
### Weekly Essay
As a task for this week, we have to do a Team, I joined Michell Team to do four exercises on Leet Code. This activity gives me a different perspective on how you can do
Teamwork, because is not just meet some day and make it all at once, we need to keep searching about different solutions and ensuring everything works well. I am staisfied about the Teamwork and this gave me learning about different programming languages and my opportunity areas. Working on a team is simple but also hard because involves soft skills like leadership, time management, own initiative. And as a hard skill, working on this activity I have found that I am not very prepared on Java language, so I need to take my notes and keep learning to stay more focus on my career, and as a mention Michell has great skills about analyzing algorithms, I was really
impressed about how people can understand their code just reading on the lines. 

When I was working I found a little hard to implement a solution was I solved on another language so I need to read the docs of that technology.

As a personal growing, I think I could make an effective work if I am more prepared for the coming problems, so one of the things I need to do is to review documentation and make research about the alogithm analysis, and also to make challenges on Java language because I am used to Typescript and I need to enlarge my knowledge.
